In case you didn't know, we've been doing some <span style="background-color: yellow;">FREE</span> hands on training in a few places.&nbsp; The next one is at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=111563&amp;src=6773869&amp;src=6773869&amp;Act=251">Disneyland </a>. If your local, this is a great way to meet some folks from product development.&nbsp; At the event is developers and product managers from Times Ten, XDM , Java, SQL Developer, SQL Developer Data Modeler, Application Express, JDeveloper, .NET, and I'm sure I'm missing someone.&nbsp; The training is based on the Oracle By Examples which have a new home on Oracle.com <a href="http://otn.oracle.com/obe">here</a>. You can try any of these OBEs online anytime.&nbsp; To make things even easier we've made the first VirtualBox Appliance with everything pre-setup. Just download and run.<br /><br />If you want to try out any of these technologies, it's easier than ever. Follow the 5 steps listed on the appliance page and you have a complete setup for running the Application Express and Database Development tracks.&nbsp; This includes:<br /><ul type="square"><li>Oracle Enterprise Linux 5</li><li>Oracle Database 11<em>g</em> Release 2  Enterprise Edition</li><li>Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database Cache</li><li>Oracle XML DB</li><li>Oracle SQL Developer</li><li>Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler</li><li>Oracle Application Express</li><li>Hands-On-Labs (accessed via the Toolbar Menu  in Firefox)</li></ul>&nbsp;The appliance is also running the latest Application Express Listener to try out.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/virtualbox/appliances/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/virtualbox/appliances/index.html</a>
