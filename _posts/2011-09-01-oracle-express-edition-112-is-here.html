Oracle XE 11.2 is now available on Windows 32 and Linux 64. &nbsp;It can be downloaded <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/express-edition/downloads/index.html">here</a>. &nbsp;I'll be shortly putting together another VirtualBox image so it can be used on other platforms. &nbsp;This is also a great database to try out the <a href="http://oracle.com/oll">Learning Library</a> labs on.<br /><br />In case anyone doesn't know, Oracle Express Edition is the free database. &nbsp;The limitation has gone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">up to 11</a>.
