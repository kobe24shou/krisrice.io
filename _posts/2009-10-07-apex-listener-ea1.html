Give it a try <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/application_express/html/apex_listener_download.html">here</a>.&nbsp; I'll be watching the Apex forum <a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=3813409&amp;#3813409">here</a> for question people may have.<br /><br />Here's a few things I forgot to put into the doc.<br /><br />1) In the zip is a sample configuration file, apex-config.xml .  This contains a short comment on each parameter.<br /><br />2) To change the default location of the config file OR the cache location.  Edit the WEB-INF/web.xml and change the config.dir or cache.dir.  These can be absolute paths /u01/klrice/ or environment variables such as ${MY_CONFIG_DIR}<br /><br />3) The apex exporter and splitter are in the apex.jar file.  Simply run "java -jar apex.jar"  The splitter is joined into the export so you can do both in one command.&nbsp; If you've not tried the splitter yet here the flags for it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -split&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Split the export file up into smaller pieces and creates an install.sql to run them all<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -flat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Normal -split make a directory structure.&nbsp; This option will keep it flat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -update&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : If you export and split over the one that was already done, this will generate an update.sql which is only the files that changed.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -nochecksum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Normally if a split is done over another one, the splitter does a checksum on the files to only touch the files that changed.&nbsp; This is very handy if you want to check into a source control only the things that change.&nbsp; So, if the only change from yesterday's export to today's is page 50.&nbsp; Then only page50.sql will get updated.<br /><br />Also there's a -zip that didn't make it into the usage which zips up the split files
