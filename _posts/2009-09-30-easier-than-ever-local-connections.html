I'm constantly trying to make things in the tool easier to get people started working with the database.  The first step is always create a connection.  You may wonder how can that get easier it's fairly simple as it is. <br /><br />Well for a local database it is now easier than ever.  I added a new context menu "Create Local Connections".  When you have a local database it will automatically setup a connection for sys,system and any user which has an open account. So now in roughly 15 seconds you have a connection to each user in your local database.  Then just simply open, enter the password and your up an running writing code.  I plan on later extending this to something like "create connection based on connection X"<br /><br /><object width="640" height="498" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-c63c4fa3f583b02" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3D0c63c4fa3f583b02%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1508099189%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3DA6ACBBDF8B3BD1711A2B98D142A42FAED7077303.4B989252F548BA25CE8B2DF7DBBA5A2B248B4619%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dc63c4fa3f583b02%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DbLJqENy436wOihlXgO_2_GN6xwM&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="498" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3D0c63c4fa3f583b02%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1508099189%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3DA6ACBBDF8B3BD1711A2B98D142A42FAED7077303.4B989252F548BA25CE8B2DF7DBBA5A2B248B4619%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dc63c4fa3f583b02%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DbLJqENy436wOihlXgO_2_GN6xwM&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object>
