&nbsp; Writing sql or any code is an iterative process. &nbsp;Most of the time that means to see what you have done say 5 minutes ago means how big is your undo buffer or better is if you are in SQL Developer there's a full blown history. &nbsp;If you are in sqlplus, you are basically out of luck.<br /><br /><h4>History</h4><div>&nbsp; SDSQL has built in history and between sessions. &nbsp;We are still jiggling where it stores the history so from EA1 to next it's most likely going to change to be configurable and default to your PWD. &nbsp;That means a possible shared history OR a per folder history. &nbsp;If you type as little as possible like me, simply typing h will print the history upto the last 100 commands.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vvqNYSV5lG0/VIhLOsRTzKI/AAAAAAAAA30/9s6YMJdMheU/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.31.25.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vvqNYSV5lG0/VIhLOsRTzKI/AAAAAAAAA30/9s6YMJdMheU/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.31.25.png" /></a></div>&nbsp; But wait there's more. &nbsp;Try "history full" and you get the not condensed sql for example from the previous screenshot item #36 is ugly and not what I typed in. &nbsp;I use typed very loosely since I pasted it. &nbsp;Typing history full shows the real sql<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R8c_yLyOQOY/VIhM_m-RyGI/AAAAAAAAA4A/V4zXthfXc-M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.38.25.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R8c_yLyOQOY/VIhM_m-RyGI/AAAAAAAAA4A/V4zXthfXc-M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.38.25.png" /></a></div><br />&nbsp; Curious how many time a statement user executed? Try typing "history usage" and now it shows how many times with a number in parentheses. &nbsp;For example here, I forget a lot what emp looks like so I've done "info emp" 11 times.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_00_FGJ8MmM/VIhNaoBhTBI/AAAAAAAAA4I/VAidHCB9z5M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.39.49.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_00_FGJ8MmM/VIhNaoBhTBI/AAAAAAAAA4I/VAidHCB9z5M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.39.49.png" /></a></div><br /><br />If you read my history, you probably noticed the alias command in here. &nbsp;Check out the help for it and give it a try.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-84i23GjVroQ/VIhPtPoN6iI/AAAAAAAAA4U/QYRXcqCtqzs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.49.37.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-84i23GjVroQ/VIhPtPoN6iI/AAAAAAAAA4U/QYRXcqCtqzs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-10%2Bat%2B08.49.37.png" /></a></div><br /><br />
