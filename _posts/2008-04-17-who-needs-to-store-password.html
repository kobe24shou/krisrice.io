<p>In sqldeveloper 1.5, if you don't want to have the option of saving the password for a connection try this:</p><br /><p>Edit the sqldeveloper/bin/sqldeveloper.conf and add this:</p><br /><p>AddVMOption -Dsqldev.savepasswd=false<br /></p><br /><p>Adding this will remove the checkbox to have the ability to save the password. I added this a while back and forgot until a recent post on the forums reminded me. A customer needed to for some complicity they had to meet.<br /></p><br /><br />
