Someone recently told me they didn't know you could turn off extensions you don't use in sqldev so I thought a quick blog may be in order. <br /><br />Since SQL Developer and jDeveloper are based on the concept of extensions, they can do things like check for updates or install new extensions very easily. &nbsp;The other side of that is that you can disable the extensions you don't use. &nbsp;A couple example of things we include by default but you may not use are the modeler, migrations, and times ten support. &nbsp;All you have to do is goto Tools-&gt;Preferences in the main menu and then uncheck the ones you don't want. &nbsp;The result is some menus don't get installed, some code is now not running at startup and you have a slimmer IDE since you turned off the parts you don't use anyway.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/TMiH4akl-NI/AAAAAAAAAW8/zauDmEbq9Fw/s1600/screen-capture-1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/TMiH4akl-NI/AAAAAAAAAW8/zauDmEbq9Fw/s1600/screen-capture-1.png" /></a></div><br /><br />
