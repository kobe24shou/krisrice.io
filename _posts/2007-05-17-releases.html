In the last week, the team has released 3 times.<br /><br />1) SQL Developer <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/sql/index.html">1.1.3</a> was released<br />2) Jdev 11 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/11/index.html">Preview</a> was released where sqldev is built in<br />3) SQL Developer Migrations <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/migration//workbench/index_sqldev_omwb.html">EA #2 </a>was minutes ago posted.  If your running 1.1.3, you'll see the update balloon soon.<br /><br /><br />However, I looked up some stats on usage and the majority of people are using 1.0.0 which was release March 2006.  Here's the release notes for <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/sql_developer/files/relnotes_v113.html">1.1.3 </a>so you can see what your missing.
