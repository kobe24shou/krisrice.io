<div class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the 3rd year&nbsp;</span>Chet aka&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/oraclenerd">oraclenerd</a>&nbsp; and I have organized the Sunday Symposium. &nbsp;This year has a bunch of great speakers with great content. &nbsp;So, if you are debating at all getting to KScope a day early to make the symposium, here's the agenda for the DB Symposium and debate no more get there early !</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><b>Starting off the APEX and DB tracks will be combined. &nbsp;</b></span></h3><div class="p2" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><h4><span class="s1">Oracle Database Tools &nbsp;- &nbsp;<a href="http://michaelhichwa.blogspot.com/">Mike Hichwa</a>&nbsp;</span></h4><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Mike Hichwa, Vice President of Database Tools, will provide an insight into the latest development of database tools and the Oracle Database Cloud Service. Everybody who is currently utilizing Oracle database tools should attend this session.&nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><h4><span class="s1">Restful Access to Your Data &nbsp;- &nbsp;<a href="http://michaelhichwa.blogspot.com/">Kris Rice</a>&nbsp;</span></h4><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Representational State Transfer (REST) enables data to be shared over HTTP(s) allowing data access from virtually any platform or language. Oracle REST Data Services ( ORDS ) make this easier than ever to RESTfully enable your database. This session will start with an overview of what REST is and why it is growing in popularity as well as cover all the upcoming features in ORDS that includes: Auto enablement of relational data, Oracle Database 12 JSON support, and Oracle NoSQL support. &nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><b>Split to separate DB track</b></span></h3><div class="p2" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><h4><span class="s1">Best PL/SQL Features You Never Heard Of (or certainly don’t use) &nbsp;- <a href="http://www.stevenfeuerstein.com/">Steven Feuerstein</a></span></h4><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Hop out of the deep ruts of your programming habit and learn how to take advantage of some under-utilized but very powerful features of the finest database programming language in Planet Earth.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><h4><span class="s1">Storing and Querying JSON Data in Oracle Database 12c &nbsp;- &nbsp;Mark Drake&nbsp;</span></h4><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>JSON has been widely adopted as a mechanism for persisting structured and semi-structured data in recent years. Application developers are particularly attracted to the schema later / schema never nature of JSON, which allows them to evolve their application data model at will. The rising popularity of JSON has been accompanied by wider adoption of 'document stores' such as MongoDB and CouchDB.</div><div class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></div><div class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; This session will show how new features of Oracle Database 12c allow the database to be used as a JSON document store. It will show how the database can deliver JSON storage, indexing and queryability, combined with performance, and full life-cycle support for JSON data, while still providing developers with all the flexibility that attracted them to JSON in the first place. The session will also touch on new API’s that make it very easy to use the Oracle Database as a JSON Document store. These new APIs are designed to support the programming paradigms and frameworks used by today’s cutting-edge developer They enable the use of popular document centric approaches, such as REST, &nbsp;to be used to perform Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete operations on JSON documents managed by an Oracle database, without having to make use of traditional relational technology such as SQL, OCI, or JDBC.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><h4><span class="s1">Oracle SQL Developer and Oracle Database 12c &nbsp;- <a href="http://thatjeffsmith.com/">Jeff Smith</a></span></h4><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Discover and exploit new Oracle Database 12c features such as multitenant container databases and data redaction with Oracle SQL Developer. This session also covers other Oracle Database 12c SQL and PL/SQL language enhancements that are available to all Oracle SQL Developer users.&nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><h4><span class="s1">Applications HA Solutions for Planned and Unplanned Database Outages -<a href="http://db360.blogspot.com/"> Kuassi Mensah&nbsp;</a></span></h4><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Upon database instance outage, applications are confronted with four issues: (1) hang and control loss, (2) error handling, (3) reliable determination of the outcome of in-flight work, and (4) resubmission of uncommitted transactions. This session introduces Oracle Database 12cApplication Continuity, which addresses all four issues. Fast Application Notification addresses the hang, Recoverable Error classification enables applications to interpret SQL exceptions without maintaining a list of error codes, Transaction Guard enables reliable determination of the outcome of in-flight work, and Application Continuity solves the resubmission of the uncommitted transaction. The session also discusses configuration and design considerations.</div>
