SQL Developer 4.1 is out for tire kicking. &nbsp;There's a lot of new things in there as well as some great enhancements. &nbsp;There's a nice shiny new Instance Monitor to get an overview of what's going on. &nbsp; Keep in mind this is in flux from a UI stance and the final may be quite different that what you see today. &nbsp;There's tons of data here and mostly all things have drill downs.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bEsVatnUYoc/VIXZkIn54RI/AAAAAAAAA3I/cnh6VhkCIes/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B12.01.41.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bEsVatnUYoc/VIXZkIn54RI/AAAAAAAAA3I/cnh6VhkCIes/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B12.01.41.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />Also, we took the sqlplus engine we have and built a command line for it and named it SDSQL. &nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/thatjeffsmith">Someone</a> will say this stands for sql developer sql but let's not dwell on names. &nbsp;This new command line has TONS of things in it. &nbsp;Please keep in mind this is an EA. &nbsp;The new command line is very very compatible with sqlplus in fact I alias sqlplus to my sdsql and that's all I use now. &nbsp;However, this is an EA and it is not 100% sqlplus and may never be there's some very odd old things that sqlplus does like did you know "SQL&gt; #create table klr_1 ( id number );" works? &nbsp;Yeah , we're not doing that.<br /><br />Anyway, grab it, try it, see what you think. &nbsp;On the 4.1 download page there's a section for SDSQL. &nbsp;Just grab that and as usual just unzip and ./sdsql. &nbsp; This screenshot shows color coding and a nice compact printing of the results of a query. &nbsp;This results is buffered and the col headers are set to the max of the datasize completely ignoring whatever your linesize is set to. &nbsp;The catch is only 5k rows is supported since it's buffering. &nbsp;Query over 5k and you'll get a nice warm message that says unsupported.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JG2DTGlZ-pw/VIXfyaF4JMI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/6YnR0RKgsEo/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B12.28.04.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JG2DTGlZ-pw/VIXfyaF4JMI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/6YnR0RKgsEo/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B12.28.04.png" /></a></div><br /><br />Here's my Login.sql if you want to try it out.<br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush: shell">set sqlformat ansiconsole<br />set sqlprompt '"@|red _USER|@@@|green _CONNECT_IDENTIFIER|@@|blue,bg_green,bold &gt;|@"<br /></pre><br /><br />If you want different colors, here's a script that shows a lot of the possibilities.<br /><br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush: sql">select '@|red,bold,underline This is red,bold,underline|@' "@|red Colors|@"  from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|NEGATIVE_ON  This is negative|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|INTENSITY_FAINT  This is faint|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|INTENSITY_BOLD  This is my bold|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|ITALIC  This is italic|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|UNDERLINE  This is underline|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|BLINK_SLOW  This is blink_slow|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|BLINK_FAST  This is blink_fast|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|CONCEAL_ON  This is conceal|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|black  This is black|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|green  This is green|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|yellow This is yellow|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|blue  This is blue|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|magenta  This is magenta|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|cyan   This is cyan|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|white  This is white|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_red  This is bg_red|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_black  This is bg_black|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_green  This is bg_green|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_yellow This is bg_yellow|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_blue  This is bg_blue|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_magenta  This is bg_magenta|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_cyan   This is bg_cyan|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_white  This is bg_white|@'   from dual<br />union all<br />select '@|bg_red  This is bg_red|@'   from dual<br /><br /></pre><br />And here's what you'll see from it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Dy40GYqT3so/VIXizmfsBsI/AAAAAAAAA3k/qksEJ-eXrI0/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B12.41.15.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Dy40GYqT3so/VIXizmfsBsI/AAAAAAAAA3k/qksEJ-eXrI0/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B12.41.15.png" /></a></div>
