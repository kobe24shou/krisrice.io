There's a few more of the OTN Database Developer Day free training events coming up. <br /><br />The first is next week in Reston,VA. This is the full four track event. &nbsp;If you are able to make it, it's a great chance to talk to some of the development staff that run the event. &nbsp;<a href="http://michaelhichwa.blogspot.com/">Mike Hichwa</a> will be giving the keynote.<br /><br />The agenda for this even can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/dm/h2fy11/77471-wwmk11054222mpp004c004-oem-452411.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen">http://www.oracle.com/us/dm/h2fy11/77471-wwmk11054222mpp004c004-oem-452411.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen</a><br /><br /><br />The second and the most widely&nbsp;available&nbsp;is going to be on September 13th at 9am Pacific. &nbsp;This &nbsp;will be our first virtual one version of the event we've been doing live for over a year. &nbsp;The virtual event is great for people that can't make it to the live ones. &nbsp;You can register here:<br /><a href="https://oracle.6connex.com/portal/database/login/?langR=en_US&amp;mcc=SQLDevblogVDDDB9132011">https://oracle.6connex.com/portal/database/login/?langR=en_US&amp;mcc=SQLDevblogVDDDB9132011</a><br /><br />The agenda for the day is here:&nbsp;<a href="https://oracle.6connex.com/upload/124/483/1314393443040_67_.pdf">https://oracle.6connex.com/upload/124/483/1314393443040_67_.pdf</a><br /><br />The lastly is a Database only track coming up on September 20th in Calgary. &nbsp;For this day, we are only running the 1 track and it's database focused. &nbsp;There's Application Express, Times Ten, XML DB, and of course&nbsp;SQL Developer and Modeler.<br /><br />The agenda for this even can be found here: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/ns/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=140137&amp;src=7328803&amp;src=7328803&amp;Act=14">http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/ns/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=140137&amp;src=7328803&amp;src=7328803&amp;Act=14</a><br /><br /><br />As always, all these events use the&nbsp;Database App Development VM. If you've not heard of it before, it's a VM that we build which is preconfigured with all the software and material for most of the labs ( minus .NET and jdev ) &nbsp;It's an 11.2.0.2 EE version of the database with Application Express 4 ( yes we're updating it ), SQL Devleoper and Modeler 3, Times Ten 11r2, the APEX Listener, and all the labs themselves. &nbsp;Even if you can't make one of the events give the labs a try yourself but getting the VM from here: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/developer-vm/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/developer-vm/index.html</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><div><br /></div>
