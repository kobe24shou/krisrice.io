Hopefully by now everyone knows there's the ability in SQLcl to use Javascript and the same javascript can be used to make custom commands extending what SQLcl offers out of the box.<br /><br />Also, I hope everyone knows we are posting examples of this to github as a base for anyone to learn and try it out. &nbsp;Just in case here's the link to the GitHub location <a href="https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-tools/tree/master/sqlcl">https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-tools/tree/master/sqlcl</a><br /><br />The last example I did was for ApexExport which took the tried and true ApexExporter java utility that ships with Apex and converted it to JavaScript.&nbsp;<a href="http://krisrice.blogspot.com/2016/10/export-apex-application-with-sqlcl.html">http://krisrice.blogspot.com/2016/10/export-apex-application-with-sqlcl.html</a><br /><br />One of first questions was from Vito about an import counterpart.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/krisrice">@krisrice</a> Is there an equivalent apximp to the apxexp in the pipeline? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sqlcl?src=hash">#sqlcl</a></div>â€” Vito Campanelli (@VitoDCampanelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitoDCampanelli/status/788790821977989120">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><br /><br />Here's that counterpart which is leveraging&nbsp;apex_application_install for setting options to be used. This screenshot is showing loading the command straight from github which I wouldn't recommend if there is ever a need to be offline using the command. &nbsp;There's a Download/Clone button right on the github space home page then all the file are local and be used anytime regardless of network connectivity.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gm1jv5CFXSI/WCy_eb_hdfI/AAAAAAAABN4/SQqeGPhFyYQvEBt6k3wVP1WvfpvHGM_lACK4B/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-11-16%2Bat%2B3.19.45%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="506" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gm1jv5CFXSI/WCy_eb_hdfI/AAAAAAAABN4/SQqeGPhFyYQvEBt6k3wVP1WvfpvHGM_lACK4B/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-11-16%2Bat%2B3.19.45%2BPM.png" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><br />When the command is called it echos out all the options being used. In the case of multiple workspaces and none being specified right or wrong it's going to use this sql to determine which to use:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;select min(workspace_id) wsID &nbsp;from &nbsp;apex_workspace_schemas where schema = user<br /><br />If that's not correct, no problems just pass in -workspaceid<br /><br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">KLRICE@orcl &gt;apximp  -file f102.sql -offset 123 -name Kris -alias rice  -installSupportingObjects<br />*** USING DEFAULT WORKSPACE *** <br />*** KLRICE *** <br />** Importing with the following options **<br />Application Alias :rice<br />Workspace ID :1930920493850173<br />Application Name :Kris<br />Offset :123<br />****<br /></pre><br /><br />The script is here:<br /><script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/http://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-tools/blob/master/sqlcl/examples/apximp.js"></script><br />
