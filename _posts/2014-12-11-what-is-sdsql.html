&nbsp; SQL Developer is now up to version 4.1 and has had many additions over the years to beef up the sqlplus compatibility. &nbsp;This is used today by millions of users adding up to millions if not billions of hours in the tool doing their work. &nbsp;That means our support of core sqlplus has to be very full featured. &nbsp;One idea we kicked around for a while but never had the time to do was to make our sqlplus engine available on a command line. &nbsp;The huge benefit of this is that we could then run the actual sqlplus regression tests against our code line.<br /><br /><h4>Enter SDSQL</h4><div>&nbsp; We did exactly that. &nbsp;The guts of SQL Developer's sqlplus support married with a command line interface. &nbsp;The result is a 10mb download soon with native installers. &nbsp;That 10mb includes everything you need including the jdbc driver. &nbsp;Now while replicating sqlplus is interesting and will greatly improve our support for it, it's well boring. &nbsp;Writing code that does nothing more than mimic other code isn't fun. &nbsp;So we are adding lots and lots of new things. &nbsp; The first things you'll notice using sdsql is the arrow keys work, there's history, there's color these and more are just core things we added. &nbsp;There's also entirely new commands being added and the easiest way to see some of these new things is to use the help command. &nbsp;The non-sqlplus command are highlighted. &nbsp;Give them a try.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P6RbWqbUfw4/VInvbPEu8MI/AAAAAAAAA4k/et5FaJ9xo2k/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-11%2Bat%2B14.21.56.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P6RbWqbUfw4/VInvbPEu8MI/AAAAAAAAA4k/et5FaJ9xo2k/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-11%2Bat%2B14.21.56.png" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Help</td></tr></tbody></table><div>Here's something added for Bryn which is pretty much obvious yet never been in sqlplus. &nbsp;I'm in sqlplus and want to change directory to a new path and run some scripts. &nbsp;In sqlplus, you either exit, cd, and start back up or path all the scripts like @my/other/path/script.sql<br /><br />Now there's a built in "cd" command.</div><div><br /></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/krisrice">@krisrice</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/thatjeffsmith">@thatjeffsmith</a> More generally on SQL*Plus ++ a "cd" command (implies "pwd" too) to allow ad hoc script running with less typing.<br />— Bryn Llewellyn (@BrynLite) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrynLite/status/538805691944026112">November 29, 2014</a></blockquote><br /><br />Here's a quick example. &nbsp;I start the tool in one path , raptor_common, &nbsp;then need to run a script in the sub directory. &nbsp;A quick cd examples then @color.sql. &nbsp;All host operations are now in that path. &nbsp;That means running a script, spooling a file, host commands, ...<br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql;">KLRICE@ORCL&gt;┌─[14:29:56]─[klrice]─[kriss-MacBook-Pro-2]:~/workspace/raptor_common$<br />└─&gt;./sdsql klrice/klrice@localhost/orcl<br /><br />sdsql: Release 4.1.0 Beta on Thu Dec 11 14:30:04 2014<br /><br />Copyright (c) 1982, 2014, Oracle.
