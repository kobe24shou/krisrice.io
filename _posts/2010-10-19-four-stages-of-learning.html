I went to a great set of classes this weekend and wanted to share one of the things I learned. &nbsp;The classes had nothing at all to do with any form of technology, it was to get a hockey coaching license. &nbsp;It was a very fun class since we got to meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Baker">Jamie Baker</a> and<a href="http://sharks.nhl.com/club/page.htm?bcid=29015"> Jay Woodcroft</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;One slide was on the four stages of competence. &nbsp;I don't think I've seen this before but it's on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence">wikipedia</a> and something that has been around for quite some time. &nbsp; It breaks down the process into combination of 2 factors, Competence and Consciousness.<br /><br />Taking those 2 factors there are 4 stages of learning. &nbsp;Here's the process from the highest level to the lowest.<br /><br />1) Competence and Unconscious <br />&nbsp;- This is where you have become competent in the area you are learning to the level that you are unconsciously&nbsp;react to accomplish something.<br />&nbsp;-&nbsp;How times do you do things on autopilot? &nbsp;Your training has progress to the highest level and due to the number of&nbsp;repetitions&nbsp;it's been done it's just an automatic response now.<br /><br />2) Competence and Conscious<br />&nbsp;- You have the competence&nbsp;however are conscious of what you are doing.<br />&nbsp;- How many times do you have to stop and think about what to do? &nbsp;Then have a little thought it's easy using the skills you already have.<br /><br />3) Incompetence and Conscious<br />&nbsp;- You don't have the skills yet but are aware of what needed to accomplish the need.<br />&nbsp;- How many times do you know how to get where you need to be yet have to breakout a manual/book/something to find the skills needed to get there?<br /><br />4) Incompetence and Unconscious <br />&nbsp;- You are just starting out so there's not a high skill level nor the awareness to know what needs to be done.<br />&nbsp;-&nbsp;How often have you started a new project and not known where to go or how to start it? <br /><br />
