However, the same war file is still deployable as before into your webserver of choice.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here's the 5 steps to get a fully functional web server running against APEX.<br /><br />1) Download Here : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex-listener/downloads/index.html<br />2) unzip<br />3) type: java â€“jar apex.war<br />4) Then just follow command line prompts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You'll be asked for the images location , admin and manager for the listener<br />5) When the browser pops open fill in the database connect information<br /><br />Done.<br /><br />Here's a couple of the command line options. <br /><br />-Dapex.home=/path/to/apex : Path to the folder used to store the&nbsp;web container runtime,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; defaults to:&nbsp;${user.home}/.apex/nnnn, &nbsp;where nnnn is the HTTP listen port<br />-Dapex.port=nnnn : HTTP listen port,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; defaults to 8080<br />-Dapex.images=/images/location : Path to the folder containing static images<br /><br />In the doc see the "Using the Embedded Web Container" for more details<br /><br /><br />For the curious, what we did was embed Grizzly from the glassfish project , https://grizzly.dev.java.net .&nbsp; This is a project designed for this use.&nbsp; Embedding a webserver and servlet container for specialized purpose. <br /><br /><br />The other big addition is the java docs for the extension points.&nbsp; More on that coming..... <br /><br />
