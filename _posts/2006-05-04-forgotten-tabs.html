So, you say we missed adding a partition tab or a <a href="http://pjs-random.blogspot.com/2006/05/i-like-sql-developer.html">MV column stats</a>.  I'd say it's an opportunity for you to add it exactly how you'd like it.  This can all be done via xml and a command line flag<br /><br /><br />It's really easy to add tabs to an object when clicked in the tree.<br /><br /><pre><br />&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br />&lt;items&gt;<br /> &lt;item type="editor" node="TableNode"  vertical="true"&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Modifications]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br />      &lt;query&gt;<br />         &lt;sql&gt;&lt;![CDATA[select * from ALL_TAB_MODIFICATIONS where  table_owner = :OBJECT_OWNER and table_name = :OBJECT_NAME]]&gt;&lt;/sql&gt;<br />        &lt;/query&gt;<br /> &lt;/item&gt;<br />&lt;/items&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Hopefully most of this is pretty straight forward.  Here's a few thing explained:<br /><br />First the item tag has a couple attibutes <br /><br />type="editor"This is required right now and the only value is "editor"<br /><br />node="TableNode" This is the node which the tab will show up on.  See the list below for all supported values.<br /><br />vertical="true"This will make the report vertical since I know this sql will return only 1 row.  It makes it much easier to read. Leave this attribute out or no value and the report will be a normal data grid of the results<br /><br />Here's the list of valid values for the node attribute:<br />IndexNode<br />TriggerNode<br />PlSqlBaseNode<br />MViewLogNode<br />DatabaseLinkNode<br />RecycledObjectNode<br />SequenceNode<br />SynonymNode<br />MViewNode<br />ViewNode<br /><br />The thing that probably stands out is the binds.  Here's the list of binds that are supported:<br />:OBJECT_NAME       name of the object  <br />:OBJECT_TYPE        type of the object <br />:OBJECT_OWNER   owner of the object<br />:COLUMN_NAME     name of the column ( if a column was right clicked <br />:OBJECT_ID             object_id from all_objects <br />:USER                       user which is connected to the database <br /><br />Now all that's needed is to tell SQL Developer to load the file.  This is very easy:<br /><br />-Draptor.user.editors=/home/klrice/editors.xml <br /><br />There can only be one file right now.  In a future release, I'll get a registerEditors call added as well as the ability to have multiple files passed on the command line just like the snippets and reports have now.<br /><br />If people find this usefull , well I'll do it anyway.  I'll follow this up with how to add master/detail ( index columns ) and top results with bottom code ( triggers ).
