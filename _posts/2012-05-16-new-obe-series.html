I'm sure most people know by now that we have a VM we build and run the OTN Developer Day events based on those VMs. &nbsp;The key to running the events is the Oracle By Example labs. &nbsp;They are a great way to learn the tools and software in the VM.<br /><br />What everyone may not know is all the OBEs are online as well. &nbsp;The are runnable anywhere not just in the VM we build. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/oll">Oracle Learning Library</a> has <u>TONS</u> of great labs to learn. &nbsp;The labs are tagged to make it very easy to find what you are looking for.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.oracle.com/oll"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MK296gFzc9o/T7QsrBM8LtI/AAAAAAAAAgk/NLMxFXcFgRI/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-05-16+at+3.39.18+PM.png" /></a></div><br />The latest addition is something we kicked around and everyone liked. &nbsp;That's a series where the labs build upon the previous lab to learn more than 1 topic for 1 hour then switch to another topic.<br /><br />What we came up with is the&nbsp;<a href="http://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:24:0::NO::P24_CONTENT_ID,P24_PREV_PAGE:6265,1">Application Developer Days Workshop Series</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;This series starts in the SQL Developer Data modeler, then&nbsp;writing&nbsp;plsql in SQL Developer, then creating an app in APEX. &nbsp;So a soup-to-nuts idea. &nbsp;Starting from a clean slate and progressing into a functioning application.<br /><br />Give it a try!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:24:0::NO::P24_CONTENT_ID,P24_PREV_PAGE:6265,1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-19kOHy1QLIo/T7QtoM9GOVI/AAAAAAAAAgs/dEkzN34j1wk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-05-16+at+3.43.29+PM.png" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
