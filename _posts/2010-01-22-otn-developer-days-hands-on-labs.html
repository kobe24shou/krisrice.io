&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week we hosted a <b><i>free </i></b>event for developers in New York.&nbsp; The main purpose of this event was to help introduce people to things they may not use day to day or know of.&nbsp; The full agenda is<a href="http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=101955&amp;src=6773869&amp;src=6773869&amp;Act=85"> here</a>.&nbsp; The best part of this for people is that development staff is on hand to answer questions.  This is also the first time I ever gave a keynote which the <a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B99yrD1r9zhCMTVjYWE5N2YtYWUzMy00ZDAxLTkwZTEtNDE4ZmMxYzBjOWVi&amp;hl=en">slides can be seen here.</a>&nbsp; We will be bringing this to other cites and countries.<br /><br />&nbsp; Even if you can't attend an event the entire development community will benefit because we're working out how to host virtual machines onto OTN that are setup for the labs that are in the event.&nbsp; The labs will be contained in the VM. This means to do a lab it'll be something like 1)download 2)start VM 3) start lab.&nbsp; Nice and simple.The VM for this event had:<br /><ul><li>Oracle Database 11G Release 2</li><li>Oracle Times Ten 11G Release 2</li><li>Oracle SQL Developer 2.1</li><li>Oracle Application Express 3.2.1</li><li>Oracle SQL Developer Datamodeler 2.0</li></ul><br />The nicest thing about this VM approach is zero installs to get tinkering instantly.&nbsp; I'm in the process of updating a few things in the VM and when that's completed we should be getting them onto OTN.
