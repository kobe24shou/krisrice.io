Everything seems fine when there is no problems.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/krisrice/4307451039/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4307451039_69792d3b0e_m.jpg" /></a><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">My son at an exhibition game.</span><br /></div>Then something goes wrong.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/krisrice/4307448671/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4307448671_a3eb876dfa_m.jpg" /></a><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>or why would anyone code without Source Control?<br /><br />Why would someone do either? We've all done the second.&nbsp; I'm going to guess not all of us have done the first but it physically hurts more.&nbsp; We know better than to code without backups or without checking things into some system but I get a lot of people that ask how to get started. Well,...<br /><br />I have a talk at <a href="http://www.teamycc.com/RMOUG_2010_Conference/Presentations.html#Rice">RMOUG</a> in a couple weeks.  This talk is going to be focused how to setup a source control system then add continuous integration.&nbsp; We will use SQL Developer to check-in/out/patch the code.&nbsp; We're going to start with just a bunch of files in a filesystem.&nbsp; We are going to end up with a source code control and an integrated continuous integration running to build a stage system automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp; based on when code is checked in and emails when builds fail! <br /><br />We'll be using Oracle 11G Release 2, Oracle SQL Developer, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a> and Perl for a small script.<br /><br />If your not coming to the show but are interested, I'll be writing up in more details here after the show. If there's something that you think should be addressed, let me know.<br /><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br /></div>
