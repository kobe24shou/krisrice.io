I just pushed sqldeveloper <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/sql/index.html">1.1.3</a>.  There's about 200 bug fixes in this build some more visible ones are <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/sql_developer/files/BugsFixed_v113.html">here</a>.  There are a couple new things like a couple more sqlplus command supported , print , accept.  The other thing that you will notice is new reports.<br /><br /><br />Mike Hichwa added some reports for Application Express.  So now you can easily see the applications you have access to and some details about them.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNSJPL9IzI/AAAAAAAAACM/qU55H7Bx2Cc/s1600-h/ishot-1.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNSJPL9IzI/AAAAAAAAACM/qU55H7Bx2Cc/s320/ishot-1.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5062980724743545650" /></a><br /><br /><br />The best thing about these reports is that Mike added them using nothing more than the report dialogs.  The only thing that was manually added was the check for version of apex and that was just editing the xml file.<br /><br />Here's what the Applications report looks like. <br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNSOvL9I0I/AAAAAAAAACU/TShUuIPUrbU/s1600-h/ishot-2.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNSOvL9I0I/AAAAAAAAACU/TShUuIPUrbU/s320/ishot-2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5062980819232826178" /></a><br /><br /><br />Here's another that let's you see the images the workspace.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNTavL9I2I/AAAAAAAAACk/fh-YfiBttqw/s1600-h/ishot-5.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNTavL9I2I/AAAAAAAAACk/fh-YfiBttqw/s320/ishot-5.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5062982124902884194" /></a><br /><br /><br />The only down side is that APEX 3.0.1 is required and it hasn't been released yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNSTvL9I1I/AAAAAAAAACc/2o3nD-ZtXNk/s1600-h/ishot-3.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HTPuwjEAZfk/RkNSTvL9I1I/AAAAAAAAACc/2o3nD-ZtXNk/s320/ishot-3.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5062980905132172114" /></a><br />
