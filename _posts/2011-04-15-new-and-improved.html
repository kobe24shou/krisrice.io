&nbsp;&nbsp; The SQL Developer Exchange ,  <a href="http://sqldeveloper.oracle.com/">http://sqldeveloper.oracle.com</a>, &nbsp;has been out there almost since the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;of the tool. &nbsp;It's our way to allow users to log requests and have other vote on them. &nbsp;Then we each release pick off some and put them into the product. &nbsp;It's been basically unchanged since day 1. &nbsp;This week I've built a new set of screens which hopefully look better and are easier to use. &nbsp; We have implemented over 400 requests from users. &nbsp;The exchange is have a bit of a facelift and if anyone would like to test out the new Exchange go here <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=43135:1">https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=43135:1</a> . &nbsp;This is the same tables and data underpinnings so if you log or rate a request it will show in both place.
