Since new coding is pretty much ramped down for SQL Developer , I needed a place to test out some features in a way that everyone can benifit.   I've created a project on sourceforge, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/esdev">http://sourceforge.net/projects/esdev</a>.  The current extension there enables support for readonly XMLTypes and adds export to excel in native excel inthe worksheet thanks to <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/">Poi</a>.<br /><br /><br />I hope this project also shows how easy it is to extend base functionality.  The web cvs isn't working yet but once it is, take a look and see what it took to add this.  <br /><br />If you would like to see these examples in action, add the center.xml to your check for update.  The center file is <a href="http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/esdev/center.xml">http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/esdev/center.xml</a><br /><br />I'll probably tinker here with trying to intergrate some open source projects into sql developer.
